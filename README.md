- This is members-only application. 

Why did I do this?
- First of all I wanted to learn how authentication forkflow works. 
- I learnt:
	- Why we use cookies and sessions, 
	- How cookies and sessions relate, 
	- How to sign-up and sign-in users,
	- How to set and reset passwords for users,
	- How to keep passwords safe in database, i.e. how to hash them.
