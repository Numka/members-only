# Deployed version:
- https://members-only-numinor.herokuapp.com

# Description
- This is members-only application. It's part of https://www.theodinproject.com/ node course. I was tasked to make my own version, which you can see here. I dont think that this is finished project. Although, core functionality is there I intend to improve it incremently, i.e. over time and bit by bit.

# Why did I do this?
- First of all I wanted to learn how authentication forkflow works. 
- I learnt:
	- Why we use cookies and sessions, 
	- How cookies and sessions relate, 
	- How to sign-up and sign-in users,
	- How to set and reset passwords for users,
	- How to keep passwords safe in database, i.e. how to hash them.
